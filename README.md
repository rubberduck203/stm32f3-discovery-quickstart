# `stm32f3-discovery-quickstart`

Template to develop bare metal Rust applications for the [STM32F3DISCOVERY][stm32f3discovery] board.
Utilizes the [stm32f3-discovery board support crate](https://crates.io/crates/stm32f3-discovery).

## Dependencies

To build embedded programs using this template you'll need:

- Rust 1.31 or a newer toolchain.
- The `cargo generate` subcommand. [Installation
  instructions][cargo-generate-install].
- `rust-std` components (pre-compiled `core` crate) for the ARM Cortex-M
  target.

``` console
$ cargo install cargo-generate
$ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

## Using this template

**NOTE**: This is the very short version that only covers building programs. For
the long version, which additionally covers flashing, running and debugging
programs, check [the embedded Rust book][book] and [the Discover book][discovery-book].

``` console
$ cargo generate --git https://github.com/rubberduck203/stm32f3-discovery-quickstart
 Project Name: app
 Creating project called `app`...
 Done! New project created /tmp/app

$ cd app
$ cargo build
```

## Examples

For examples, see the [examples directory of the stm32f3-discovery repository](https://github.com/rubberduck203/stm32f3-discovery/tree/master/examples).

## VS Code

This template includes launch configurations for debugging CortexM programs with Visual Studio Code located in the `.vscode/` directory.  
See [.vscode/README.md](./.vscode/README.md) for more information.  
If you're not using VS Code, you can safely delete the directory from the generated project.
